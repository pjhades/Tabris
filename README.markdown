About
--------------
Tabirs is a simple toy Scheme interpreter written in Python.
I wrote this because:
 * I'm reading SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs).
 * I'm learning Python.
 * I want to practise Python programming on some relatively large programs.

So here you see Tabris, named after the last angle in Evangelion, who 
represents free will.


Warning
--------------
Tabris is __NOT__ finished yet. I put it here simply because I don't want
to copy my code back and forth between the lab and apartment. More code
will be added as I read SICP more.
