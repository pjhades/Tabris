About
--------------

Tabirs is a simple toy Scheme interpreter written in Python.
I wrote this because:
 * I'm reading SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs).
 * I'm learning Python.
 * I want to practise Python programming on some relatively large programs.

So here you see Tabris, named after the last angle in Evangelion, who 
represents free will.
